description: The study examines the effect of pulse voltage on CANCAN focusing of
  electroporation using electrode arrays of different sizes. Adjustments in the amplitude
  of nanosecond electroporation pulses influenced the intensity of electroporation
  but did not alter its spatial characteristics across the electrode array. The study
  was supported in part by NIH R21EY034258
